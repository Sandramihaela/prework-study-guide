          <h2>HTML</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML is the structure/base of our website.</li>
            <li>By using elements on HTML, we can give meaning to elements as well as control the font, use mark to highlight text and using different size headings and many more.</li>
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
           <li>CSS is the interactivity/paint and style of our website.</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
           <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li> 
           <li> Some good principles of CSS building and maintaining are consistency, Succinctness, and separation.</li>
<ul> 
  <li> Stay consistent with your rules! Stick to your decided variations, framework and methodology and be predictable and consistent.</li>
  <li> Being succinct means being brief and clear, and both are imperative to writing good CSS code.</li>
    <li><em>Try to keep three questions in mind when implementing CSS:<br>
    How many classes are needed to achieve the style?<br>
    How long and complex are each of the classes?<br>
    Are the class names easily understandable without context? </em></li> <br>
    <li> A Basic CSS rule pattern: <em>"selector{ property: value; }"</em></li>

      <h2>Git</h2>
     <ul>
       
       <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
    <li>git Checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
    <li>git Pull command is used to get updates from the remote repo.</li> 
    <li>git Add  include the changes of a file(s) into our next commit.</li>
    <li>git Commit Git commit saves your changes only locally and you can get back to it if needed.</li>
    <li>Git push only uploads changes that are already committed, use: git push -u origin.</li>
    <li>Git flow commands are in the following order:<br>
     1. git add -A <br>
     2. git commit -m “updated project file”<br>
     3. git pull origin main <br>
     4. git push origin "branch name"<br>

     <h2>JavaScript</h2>
     <ul>
       <li><em>"let"</em>allows you to declare variables that are block scoped, unlike the var keyword, which is function scoped.</li>
       <li> Variable declared by let cannot be redeclared and must be declared before use whereas variables declared with var keyword are hoisted.</li>
       <ul>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>

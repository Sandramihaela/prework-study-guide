# prework-study-guide
## Here are some of my Prework study guide notes as I embark on this exciting excursion of coding from square one. I have explored and learned a lot about the basics of HTML,CSS,JavaScript and Git. I now possess more confidence that I will be able to triumph and advance in my new career path I have newly selected. I wish I'm able to motivate others, especially women to persuade their coding goals and to not allow impostor syndrome demoralise them. I hope that my notes are proficient and coherent and that they will be of good use to others too.
